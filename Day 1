1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP : Hypertext transfer protocol

It is used in client-server communication. By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user.

HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it. In contrast, HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.

2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Object is a key : values it used to easly identify and easly access the datas. There are two accessing methods is there :

 	Dot method [print particaular data]
 	Box method [print set of all datas]
Example : object

let employee = { name : "Praveen", gender : "Male", job : "Full Stack devloper", age : 24 }
